# Mechanical Properties Calculator Web App
This interactive web app helps calculate mechanical properties such as Young’s Modulus, Yield Stress, Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS), and Failure Strain from data generated by a Universal Testing Machine (UTM) using .csv files.

Built using Python, Dash, Flask, and Plotly, it also visualizes:

Stress–Strain curve

Load–Displacement curve

## Features
Upload your UTM-generated .csv file

Calculate:

Initial Cross-Sectional Area

Young’s Modulus (MPa)

Yield Stress using 0.2% offset method

UTS (MPa)

Failure Strain (%)

 ## Visualize:

Load vs. Displacement Curve

Stress vs. Strain Curve


## Technologies Used
Python

Dash (by Plotly)

Flask

NumPy / SciPy

Matplotlib

Pandas
